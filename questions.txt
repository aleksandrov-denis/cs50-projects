1. What’s stdint.h?

    A header that declares integer types which are a specified number of bits and defines specific behaviors
    for those integers.

    2. What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?

    The data types define the number of bits a variable holds.

    3. How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?

    1 byte, 4 bytes, 4 bytes, 2 bytes.

    4. What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? Leading bytes
    used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."

    0x42 0x4D

    5. What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?

    bfSize is size defined in info header and biSize is size defined in file header.

    6. What does it mean if biHeight is negative?

    To make sure we start reading from the top left corner of the file.

    7. What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?

    biClrUsed and biClrImportant

    8. Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?

    It might not open correctly.

    9. Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?

    Because we need it to read the file one block, one pixel, at a time.

    10. What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?

    padding = 1

    11. What does fseek do?

    Setting a read cursor some amount of digits from the end of a file.

    12. What is SEEK_CUR?

Position from where program should read next.
